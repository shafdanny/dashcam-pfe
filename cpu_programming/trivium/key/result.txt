Entropy = 7.999659 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 532861 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 532861 samples is 251.13, and randomly
would exceed this value 50.00 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.3700 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.148113951 (error 0.21 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.001419 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
